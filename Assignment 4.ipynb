    "1.What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: These are the square brackets that are used to represent a empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    "Ans: [3.14,'cat',11,'cat',True,99]\n",

    "\n",
    "9.What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "And: The only difference between append() and insert() is that insert function allows us to add a specific element at a specified index of the list unlike append() where we can add the element only at end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: remove(), pop().\n",
    "\n",
    "12.Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A list and string are mostly similar because they contain group of elements but the only difference is that list can contain different types of elements whereas string can contain only the characters\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: List: They are mutable. They contain \"[]\" square brackets.\n",
    "     Tuple: They are immutable.They contain normal brackets.\n",

    "15.How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: list(tuple),tuple(list)\n",
    "\n",
    "16.Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: They contain a group of elements which can be of any data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "17.How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: copy.copy(): A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. \n",
    "     copy.deepcopy(): A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.\n",
