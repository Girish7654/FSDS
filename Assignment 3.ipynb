    "1.Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 1. Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. \n",
    "     2. This makes programs shorter.\n",
    "     3. Easier to read.\n",
    "     4. easier to update.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "2.When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: when it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \"def\" keyword with the function name is used to declare a function. eg: def add():,def sub():\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Function: It is what we declare a function using \"def\" keyword and function name and create a function.\n",
    "     Function call: This is where we invoke the function by calling the function name.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: One global scope and one local scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The local variables are destroyed when the function call returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "7.What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The return values returns the output of the function after certain tasks are done. Yes, it is posspossible to have a return value in an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: If a function doesn't specify a return statement, it returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: If you want to make a function variable refer to the global variable simply declare the global variable wherever it is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:It is datatype of class NoneType object.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n",
    "\n",
    "12.If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13.What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Restart the jupyter kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Try: The try clause allows you to test a block of code for errors. \n",
    "     Except: The except clause enables you to handle the error with a user-defined response.\n",
